<h1>Addition and subtraction of natural numbers</h1>


<h2>Addition</h2>

The arithmetic in which several numbers are added together (added) is called addition.

Example:
12 + 24 = 36

we denote the numbers in this example as follows:
12 → 1st summand
24 → 2nd summand
12 + 24 → addition
36 → value of the sum

The order of the 1st and 2nd summands is not relevant for the result, so they can also be swapped.

12 + 24 = 24 + 12 = 36

<h2>Subtraction</h2>

The arithmetic in which numbers are subtracted from each other is called subtraction.

Example:
36 - 12 = 24

we denote the numbers in this example as follows:
36 → minutes
12 → Subtrahend
36 - 12 → subtraction
24 → value of the difference

The order between minuend and subtrahend must not be changed, otherwise the calculation will have a different result.

36 - 12 ≠ 12 - 36

    24 ≠ -24
