# Use of MDX for storage and transfer of application data at the context of a learning tool - Client App

## Get Started

- [Online demo](https://doldsimo.github.io/mdx-import-zipfile/) or [demo](https://lern-app-data-transfer-mdx.netlify.app/)

- For local execution: <br>
> Nodejs must be installed to install node modules

1. Clone or download the repository. <br>
`git clone <url>`
2. Navigate to the cloned folder <br>
`cd ./mdx-import-zipfile`
3. Istall all nodemodules <br>
`npm install`
4. Start the application <br>
`npm start`


## How it works

After starting the application with the [online demo](https://doldsimo.github.io/mdx-import-zipfile/) or a local instance, a previously locally downloaded zip learning unit must be uploaded to the app on the start page. A sample lesson can be downloaded directly from the application home page, or found in [this](https://github.com/doldsimo/mdx-import-zipfile/tree/master/ImportData) folder.
After importing the application, the lesson starts automatically.
